React micro-annotator is a small, proof-of-concept React app to create web annotations on segments of collection documents, including both image segments and text segments. Image segments are provided by a IIIF server, text segments by an instance of knaw-huc/textrepo and annotations by an adapted version of the elucidate web annotation server.
